**Content warning: This post discusses cancer and medical treatments.**

After about 5 weeks in the post-operative ward, I was transferred to the rehabilitation ward. This was nice as the rooms were better, it had a common dining room and a physio gym. There were also other support services available, including a psychologist, occupational therapist and a social worker.

There was also a different atmosphere on the rehabilitation ward, with more patients and staff and an opportunity to meet other patients and staff.

## Recovery and Rehabilitation

I worked hard in the gym each day, using heavy weights and pushing myself to the limit (which for me was hard given the recent surgeries). It felt good to be cancer free. I could actually feel a difference in my body, like it was cleaner and healthier.

It was important to build my strength and flexibility in my residual limb. I was also working on my balance and coordination. I was using a wheelchair to get around the hospital and was working on getting out of the wheelchair and mobilising with Forearm crutches. This was important to me as it enabled me to communicate at face-2-face level.

The rehab ward also allowed for weekend passes to go home, which was a great opportunity to see my family and get a break from the hospital. It also allowed me to get a better nights sleep and do some more normal stuff like washing, cooking, swimming in the pool and going to dinner. We even managed to go to a concert [Hozier](https://hozier.com), something I hadn't done in years and something we had bought tickets for before I got sick. The concert was fantastic and a perfect. Because of my amputation I was given access to the disabled area which meant that food and drink were brought to directly to us.

## Prosthetic Limb

Once my residual limb strength and flexibility had improved, I was discharged from the hospital and started the process of getting a prosthetic limb. The first step in this process was being "cast" so that a model of my residual limb could be made.

The cast model was then used to make a prosthetic socket that can be fitted to my residual limb.

Unfortunately, while waiting for the socket to be manufactured I began to develop more pronounced swelling in my residual limb and in my groin. Additionally I had developed a skin lesion in my groin which was very painful and concerning.

## Biospsy, Scans and a new Diagnose
I visited my surgeon and he took a biopsy of the skin lesion. He also ordered a [PET Scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography) of my abdomen and pelvis.

Following the PET Scan (later that day) I was contacted by the Oncology team and they explained that the scans showed that my cancer had returned, spreading up my residual limb and into my pelvis.

This news was very upsetting, and I found it hard to process as at the time I was driving the kids from school and didn't feel comfortable to discuss it with them.

The weekend that followed was a blur of emotions as I did't know what the future held. I tried to hold it together over the weekend, so that the children didn't see me upset, but it was very difficult.
