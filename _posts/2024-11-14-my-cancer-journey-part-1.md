I've been a healthy person all my life. I've eaten well, never smoked and never been in a serious accident. I've been very lucky. I had a wonderful life and now I'm in my 50s I was looking forward to living a slower life with my partner, children and family. We had just purchased a hobby farm and were inspired to be living more rural and self-sufficient.

I had no idea that my life was about to change.

I twisted my ankle by stepping off a verandah edge that was 300mm high and fell to the ground. I'd twisted my ankle before and it would typically take 2-3 weeks to heal. This time was different. Swelling and pain set in a got progressively worse.

## Initial diagnosis
I visited my GP who sent me for scans (x-rays, MRI, ultrasound) and then referred me to a specialist. The inital diagnosis was [Pigmented villonodular synovitis](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/what-is-pvns-pigmented-villonodular-synovitis) is a type of benign (non-cancerous) tumor that arises from the soft connective tissue of joints. Although it can be painful, PVNS usually does not spread.

Based on this diagnosis the specialist was preparing for surgury to remove the tumour. On the day before the surgury, I was referred for a biopsy that involved a local anaesthetic and a needle biopsy. This actually reduced some pressure and pain. However, I was then quickly referred to a different specialist, that based on their website, was as expert in soft tissue cancers.

I met with the new specialist who was very reassuring. He explained that the biopsy showed a [Myxofibrosarcoma](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22563-myxofibrosarcoma) and that this was a cancerous tumour. He explained that it was aggressive cancer and I would likely need radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. He then order a full body PET scan to check for cancer spread.

The PET scan highlighted other small growths in the lymph nodes behind my knee and in my groin. These were subsequently biopsied and confirmed to be cancerous.


## Treatment process
### Radiation

Initially radiation treatment was planned to slow the tumour growth and harden the margins to assist with surguery. Tattoos were applied to my ankle to accurately mark the area for the radiation treatment.

The radiation dose was very high and delivered rapidly (5weeks dose in 5 days). The pain was excruciating and I was on a lot of pain medication.
However, it was found that the radiation was not effective against myxofibrosarcoma and damage the tissue causing pain, swelling and surface skin damage.

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy was the next step and I was given a 'super-sized' dose of 5 cycles. The drugs used were [Doxorubicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin) and [Ifosfamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifosfamide). Each cycle was 6 hours of infusion over 4 days with a week break in between. Initially I had a strong reaction and had to be given fluids and anti-nausea medication to enable me to get through the treatment.

Each cycle was progressively more difficult, but I was hopeful that the treatment would be effective. PET scans were completed after cycle 2 and cycle 4. The scans showed that the cancer was not responding to the treatment and my pain and swelling had reduced. This gave me confidence and I was hopeful there was a path ahead.

The chemotherapy had a very destructive effect on my body. I lost my hair, my sense of taste and smell, and I had severe nausea and vomiting. I lost 15kg in weight and was very weak. Additionally, I developed bad constipation and needed 11 blood transfusions to supplement my blood levels.

### Surgery

After 5 cycles of chemotherapy, it was agreed that additional doses would not help and simply make me weaker. So the decision was made to amputate my leg above the knee, with the intention of fitting a prosthetic leg. Additionally, the lymph nodes were removed in my groin to ensure no cancer cells were left behind.

Surgery was a very scary prospect and I was very anxious about it, but was really had no alternative. During pre-surgery I was being asked multiple times what was happening to ensure I was fully informed. This was especially real once the surgeon started to draw on my leg with a marker to show where the amputation would be.

I woke after the surgery pretty out of it as I was given Fentanyle from a epidural. Progressively I transitioned from oral pain relief and each day the physio team would come to get me up onto my remaining leg and help me to the bathroom. They also started to get me sitting upright in a chair which had a good effect on my breathing and circulation.

The next few weeks were slow and I eventually transitioned to a wheelchair. This was a nice change and I was able to get around the hospital. My amazing partner stayed with me as much as possible and brought the kids to visit almost daily. This was a great source of support and I was very lucky to have them.

## Second surgery

Lymph nodes in my groin still needed to be removed, and I was concerned about how this would impact the healing of my amputated leg. The surgeon performed the procedure to remove approximately 30 lymph nodes, leaving a 40cm scar with a drain extending from my groin through my thigh. The drain collected about 120ml of fluid daily for the first 8 days before gradually decreasing over the following days.

While I initially thought this second surgery would be relatively minor, it proved to be much more invasive than anticipated. It left me with significant pain and bruising, and temporarily slowed the recovery of my amputated leg. Despite this setback, I remained determined to progress. I worked closely with the physio team to build my strength, reduce swelling, and improve my endurance.
